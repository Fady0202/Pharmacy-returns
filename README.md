-To start the application:
    1- install flutter
    2- install android studio
    3- insure everything is updated
    4-open the application on any text editor, preferribly VSCode

-Decision making:
    1-There were no restrictions on which or how to choose a pharmacyID, so I chose one with empty Return Requests since the maximum number of return requests in single page is 15. 
    2- The button in Add Item page that navigates to Item Page is hidden until the user adds at least one item.


- No need to guide through the app it should be exactly as described
